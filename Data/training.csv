"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him.",Positive Customer Review
"The NASB team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important VA home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging Antebellum home that required the entire NASB team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough VA process. I truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. I will only recommend NASB for home loans...especially complicate VA loans",Positive Customer Review
"Dallas Goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. He was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. We were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. It was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like Dallas. Great job!",Positive Customer Review
"Comments: To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat NASB but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose NASB because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. Dallas Goodlet/ Brent Custer and the whole NASB team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. We are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. Kudos to all",Positive Customer Review

We were initially pretty skeptical about refinancing our home. Weve had personal and family issues that devastated our credit to the point where we felt that it would be a waste of time since wed never be approved. However, a real need arose when Dads declining health demanded we make room in our home so we can keep him close to us and give him the care he needs. We werent sure what to expect from Patrick G at Reliance, but we were soon reassured and thoroughly delighted when Pat informed us that we were eligible and that hed walk us through the entire process personally! There simply are no superlatives sufficient to thank you for your fantastic guidance in getting our home refinanced! You took what we assumed would be a challenging home refinance and successfully navigated us through the process to a successful conclusion. In every single step, you proved to be friendly, patient, polite, knowledgeable, professional and consistently available to us. We can't remember the last company we dealt with that returned calls and emails in such a timely manner! You even personally called on weekends when there were items that needed our attention!

I can't say enough about Adam and Pac Ben. Talk about going the extra mile!!! Holy Wow! Night and day difference from anyone else I considered and spoke with. Adam spent SOOOOOO much time, INCLUDING WEEKENDS, taking my questions, some of which I'm pretty sure were stupid, but he always took the time to walk me through and explain things very thoroughly. He also has a wonderfully calm yet passionate, knowledgeable yet approachable, and charming demeanor that made my mortgage experience so much better than I could have remotely expected. Made what could easily be unpleasant more than palatable. 

And above all, they made sure I was getting the BEST POSSIBLE DEAL for my scenario, which took some real work (no one provided a better rate, and you moght expect that ""you get what you pay for"", but not here, not at all 5 star service at the best rate you can get, why go anywhere else? 100% going back to Adam/Pac Ben when the time comes again, and I know it will.

When we put an offer on in our home, our realtor (Susan Lyon in Napa) was not familiar with either Pacific Beneficial or Alex Jocovic and asked us if we were sure about using a mortgage company in Southern CA when we were up in the North. Then the selling realtor tried pushing us to use a local lender..
After our initial conversations with Alex we knew he was the broker we wanted to work with and my wife agreed so we refused to switch to a local lender and are very happy we did! Alex went above and beyond to get things done for us and was available both way before normal business hours on a morning and into the night as well, including on weekends. 
As our purchase progressed, Susans caution changed to admiration as she complimented Alex and Pacific Beneficial to us on several occasions for their professionalism, responsiveness and commented on how easy they were making things for her on the loan side. In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in.
When it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that This is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company?... Well, we didnt and, like our realtor we had not heard of Alex or Pacific Beneficial before our loan search however we now feel that we do have a friend at the mortgage company!

I am writing this review to share what ended up being an unpleasant experience with Kirk Gay and Pacific Beneficial Mortgage to other potential customers. 

I am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan, but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate, so I used LendingTree which is how Kirk contacted me. My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyers Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed. I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirks boss admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirks boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews. It was only then that I received an email from Kirk accusing me of extorting him. I want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was I misled, but I was treated terribly as a customer once Kirk had been paid his commission. It is extremely disappointing that this brokerage would go to these lengths over $525 after the fact when they promised this a customer.

Everything I said about my loan officer holds true for the company he works for. The support staff, specifically Summer Anderson was as thorough and efficient as Rowel and as accommodating and informative.

Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! 

Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees.

I had a good gut feeling about Triumph Lending, but I wasted a lot of time checking with a few other mortgage companies.

Those other companies were all over the map. There were two I never heard back from after the pre-approval stage. One of them completely ignored one an email I sent as a follow up to a phone call. Another waited a month to call me back. Two of them promised information and ever provided it.

The real prize winner was particularly pushy and was completely unprofessional when I informed him I had decided to use Triumph lending because they're closing costs were thousands of dollars lower.

But everyone I worked with at Triumph, mostly Vanessa Flores (Loan Officer) & Alina Vargas (Loan Processor), took every question seriously, never failed to respond to a request (quickly and accurately), and I know it sounds cliche, but I felt like I was more than just a number to them.

I started a process for a mortgage loan with Triumph Lending (Network Funding) in Houston, TX. I was given a pre-approval quickly with a great Interest Rate. I was continually informed via email and phone calls thorough the entire process of the loan. My representative from Triumph Lending (Peter Lammerts) worked tirelessly to make the best deal possible for me in terms of closing costs and interest rate on top of always being available to answer any questions on a loan that, to begin with, looked like it was going to be an easy mortgage loan to process, until some difficulties on my credit report showed up. Peter was very diligent to work on the issues and was able to overcome all of the obstacles in order to do the mortgage closing on time and with my best interest in mind. I highly recommend Peter Lammerts and his team for their professionalism and efficient service.

Buying a home is complicated, there a multiple parties, and competing interests, and it can be a really stressful and frustrating experiecne. What helps enormously is working with a lender that is upfront about what it can offer and accept, in terms of type of loan, type of property, downpayment, and timing of close. 
I received a call from DLJ when my previous lender changed terms on me two weeks into escrow, and in desperation I had filled out the Lending Tree form in the hope if finding a new lender. 
At the time, I honestly thought my purchase was going to fall through. 
The next day I received a call from a number and a lender I didn't recognize. It was DLJ. Am I glad I answered the phone!
Within minutes, Adan Munoz had me back on track. DLJ's team was, across the board, knowledgable, articulate, well-coordinated, calm and constructive. They offered a product that met my needs perfectly, and got me across the finish line in record time.

Recently, I successfully financed a home loan through DLJ Financial and Senior Mortgage Banker Anthony Marroquin. I had discovered that traditional banks and online financing companies were impossible for me to work with because they held against me my record of variable income (I am a self-employed freelancer and a multi-Emmy-winning Reality TV producer who works for more than a decade on a #1 major network series.) However, DLJ carefully evaluated everything, treated me as a unique person rather than just a bunch of standard numbers to be crunched and averaged, and they made it all happen - straightforwardly, fully explained, and with no glitches.

I spent weeks working with numerous brand name banks and lending intuitions to refinance my home. I assumed this came after a particularly opportune time, as I just completed a full cycle in my full-time employment position. I had all the documents uploaded within a day or 2. My income, credit score, 401K balances were all quite respectable. However, rather than being met with the highest degree of professionalism, I was met with stumbling blocks of bureaucracy.

Then I was very fortunate to find Michael and his most dedicated professional staff at Guaranteed Rate. I was prepared once again for anything, other than the professionalism, sensitivity, and quick (and at the same time responsible) turnaround I immediately received.

The closing costs, title insurance, etc. were the lowest I have ever seen.

I closed this week, original mortgage paid off, money in my account, all with the most respectable and free flowing experience imaginable. 

Thank you, Michael and crew.

This process was simple and straight-forward. Unlike other lenders we were not continually ask to provide the same documentation repeatedly. We were very happy with how quickly and easily the loan took from start to finish. The loan officer Matthew McDevitt was available when needed, but not overbearing. We had a previous poor experience with a lender that made numerous promises, even in writing, and then as closing approached changed the deal in dramatic fashion, which was caused us to eventually decide not to move forward. This deal happened faster than anticipated with literally no hang-ups. We would totally recommend Guaranteed Rate. To those that question using an online lender, several trusted sources pointed us in this direction, but in fairness we considered that we don't really personally know our local banker either and lack of face-to-face interaction does not stop all types of business we take part in daily. We hope to never have to move again, but when we are ready to finance, we will check Guaranteed Rate again.

A friend of mine told me that he just refinanced his house for an unbelievable interest rate and I wanted to find out what the rates were in the market.

He was super helpful, friendly and ensured that he answered all my questions to ensure that we werent wasting each other's time. Joe provided different types of options, patiently explained all of them and went through pros and cons and most importantly didnt try and and sell me anything.

Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! 

Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees.

Alex was extremely helpful and always available if we had any questions or concerns. He kept in constant contact with us and told us exactly what was going to be happening and when. When any issues came up he addressed them quickly so we wouldn't have to wait longer for the closing. He was always trying to go the extra step to make sure we were taken care of.

I worked with a person name Andrew Leehy. He is a very hard working, honest person with the customers interest not the commission at heart.
",Positive Customer Review
"
Fred was awesome to work with! He is very knowledgeable in his field and is quick to respond to all calls and emails. He made sure the loan stayed on track and we closed on time, 29 days from the day we put a contract on the house. We highly recommend Fred!

A fine bank with traditional values. Just great. The people are real and the bank ""walks the talk"". A real pleasure to do business with them.

Joey was knowledgeable, very accessible and maintained a positive attitude throughout the complex refinancing process. He was a true partner, not just a functionary doing paperwork.

I trusted his judgment and he never failed me. He also has a great sense of humor.

I was hesitant to use a non-local mortgage company. My loan officer, Jeremy was more involved with the process than any local loan company Ive used previously. His customer service and knowledge has exceeded my expectations. 
I don't usually recommend people, but I would consider Jeremy as a trusted friend in the mortgage business.

Steve got it done when others couldn't. 30 day closing and he even got things done that his supervisor couldn't get done. Steve was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I went with him. He was great to work with.

Dallas is very experienced and knowledgeable. Above all, he understand that customer service is to be no less than 100%. Rain or shine Dallas was always available and never once missed a deadline or commitment to followup. While NASB obviously has given Dallas the tools and resources to be successful, Dallas is the reason our experience was so stellar.

I was extremely impressed with the proffessionalism, the quality and speed of the quotes, the ability to communicate through my preferred methods and the speed to close. After speaking to several other loan officers, it was Jon Barrett at NASB that won us over. We couldnt have been happier with the service. Great work!

I will recommend everyone I know to NASB and Dallas Goodlet. I had the best experience possible. Ive had many mortgages over my lifetime and this was by far, the most pleasurable. We received a great rate, the fees were low, and the service that Dallas provides is unmatched. Im not talking just about the mortgage industry. His service is the best Ive experienced in any industry, maybe ever. Dallas may want to quit the mortgage business and start a customer service consultation business. Very satisfied customer....

Our refinance process was a dream once we spoke with Dallas, and chose him and his bank. My husband spoke to quite a few lenders and when we got on the phone with Dallas, our choice was firm. Why is he great? Because, I know we drove him crazy! We made it extra stressful on him by being technologically illiterate. As a matter of fact, Im having my grandson type the review! Dallas was so patient and understanding with us. We had to snail mail all of the documents, we had a million questions for him, and he was a professional the entire time. He has to be one of the kindest and most empathetic people Ive ever came across. Im 58 years old and Ive had many, many, home buying and refinancing experiences, and by far, this was the easiest and most pleasurable. If you want someone who truly has your best interests at heart and someone you can completely trust, then give Dallas a call. Ive already recommended my daughter to him.... Read More
